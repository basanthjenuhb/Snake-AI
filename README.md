# Snake-AI
A program that slowly learns to play the snake game using genetically evolving neural networks(Only evolution of weight).

To run - python main.py

main.py - contains code the run the program

population.py - Manages each generation of neural networks , calculate fitness , and reproduce

dna.py - Maintains data for a single neural network

snake_imp.py - Manages the snake game ( See line 46 in snake_imp.py to adjust the speed of game )
